**Source Code:**
- `client/` folder (entire React frontend)
- `server/` folder (entire Express backend)  
- `shared/` folder (shared types and schemas)

**Data & Documentation:**
- `sample_data.csv` - Your manufacturing dataset (9,471 events)
- `README.md` - Project documentation
- `replit.md` - Technical architecture guide
- All `.md` files in root directory

**Configuration:**
- `.env.example` - Environment template
- `drizzle.config.ts` - Database configuration
