# Download ProcessGPT for Local Deployment

## Easy Download Method

Since creating a zip file isn't available in this environment, here's the simplest way to get all the files:

### Method 1: Copy Essential Files (Recommended)
You only need these key files for a working ProcessGPT installation:

**Core Application Files:**
1. `package.json` - Dependencies list
2. `package-lock.json` - Exact dependency versions
3. `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration
4. `vite.config.ts` - Build configuration
5. `tailwind.config.ts` - Styling configuration
6. `drizzle.config.ts` - Database configuration
7. `components.json` - UI component configuration

**Source Code Directories:**
- `client/` folder - Complete frontend React application
- `server/` folder - Complete backend Express server  
- `shared/` folder - Type definitions and schemas
- `scripts/` folder - Utility scripts for setup and testing

**Data Files:**
- `sample_data.csv` (located in attached_assets/ - rename to sample_data.csv)

### Method 2: Direct File Access
You can access and copy each file individually from the file browser on the left side of this interface.

### Method 3: Create Your Own Archive
Once you have the files locally, you can create your own zip file:
```bash
# After copying all files to local directory
zip -r ProcessGPT-Local.zip . -x "node_modules/*"
```
