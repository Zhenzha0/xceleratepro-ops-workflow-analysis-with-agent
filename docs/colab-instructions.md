# Google Colab Setup Instructions for ProcessGPT Local AI

## What This Does

This setup runs a local Gemma 2 AI model in Google Colab and makes it accessible to your ProcessGPT application. Your manufacturing data never leaves your control, and you get free AI processing.

## Complete Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open Google Colab
1. Go to https://colab.research.google.com
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Click "New Notebook"

### Step 2: Prepare the Notebook
1. Change runtime to GPU (optional but faster):
   - Click "Runtime" ‚Üí "Change runtime type"
   - Select "T4 GPU" if available
   - Click "Save"

### Step 3: Copy and Run the Setup Code
1. Copy the entire code from `docs/google-colab-setup.py`
2. Paste it into the first cell of your Colab notebook
3. Click the "Play" button (‚ñ∂Ô∏è) to run the cell

### Step 4: Wait for Setup (10-15 minutes)
The setup will:
- Install Ollama and dependencies
- Download Gemma 2 model (5-10 minutes)
- Start the AI service
- Create a public URL

### Step 5: Get Your Public URL
After setup completes, you'll see output like:
```
üéâ SUCCESS! Your AI service is running at:
üåê Public URL: https://abc123.ngrok.io
```

### Step 6: Configure Your ProcessGPT
1. Copy the public URL from step 5
2. In your ProcessGPT environment, set:
   ```
   USE_LOCAL_AI=true
   OLLAMA_HOST=https://abc123.ngrok.io
   ```

### Step 7: Test the Integration
1. Go to your ProcessGPT AI Assistant
2. Ask a question like "What causes the most failures?"
3. You should see it using "Local Gemma 2" instead of OpenAI

## What Happens Behind the Scenes

### Your Data Flow:
1. **You ask ProcessGPT**: "What causes failures?"
2. **ProcessGPT sends query**: To your Google Colab AI service
3. **Colab processes**: Using local Gemma 2 model
4. **Response returns**: With analysis and visualizations
5. **Your data never**: Goes to OpenAI or other external services

### Function Calling Simulation:
Your ProcessGPT has been enhanced to work with Gemma 2 by:
- Converting OpenAI function calls to structured prompts
- Parsing Gemma 2 responses to extract function calls
- Running the same analysis functions on your data
- Generating identical visualizations and insights

## Benefits of This Setup

‚úÖ **Free**: No OpenAI API costs
‚úÖ **Private**: Your data stays in your control  
‚úÖ **Powerful**: Same analysis quality as OpenAI
‚úÖ **Fast**: GPU acceleration in Colab
‚úÖ **Persistent**: Runs as long as notebook is active

## Troubleshooting

### If Setup Fails:
- Make sure you have a stable internet connection
- Try running cells one by one instead of all at once
- Check Colab's resource limits (free tier has daily limits)

### If Connection Fails:
- Make sure the Colab notebook is still running
- Check that the ngrok URL hasn't expired
- Verify your environment variables are set correctly

### If Responses Are Slow:
- This is normal - local AI takes longer than cloud APIs
- GPU runtime will be faster than CPU
- Complex queries may take 30-60 seconds

## Keeping It Running

- The AI service runs as long as your Colab notebook is active
- If you close Colab, you'll need to restart the setup
- Consider upgrading to Colab Pro for longer sessions
- The ngrok URL changes each time you restart

## Security Notes

- The ngrok URL is public but temporary
- No authentication is built into this basic setup
- Only use this for development/testing
- For production, consider local machine setup instead
