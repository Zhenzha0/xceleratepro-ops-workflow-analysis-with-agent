# Quick True Local AI Setup (Alternative to Android Emulator)

Since the Android Emulator AI Edge Gallery is stuck during model download, here's a faster alternative using your desktop:

## Option 1: Ollama (Recommended - Easiest)

### Install Ollama
```bash
# Download and install from: https://ollama.com/download
# Or via curl:
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
```

### Start Ollama and Download Model
```bash
# Start Ollama service
ollama serve

# In another terminal, download Gemma 2 (2.9GB)
ollama pull gemma2:9b

# Or use a smaller model for faster download:
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

### Connect ProcessGPT
1. Go to ProcessGPT sidebar → "AI Configuration"
2. Find "True Local AI" section
3. Set Host: `http://localhost:11434`
4. Click "Use True Local AI"
5. Test with: "Which activity has the highest failure rate?"

## Option 2: LM Studio (Alternative)

### Install LM Studio
1. Download from: https://lmstudio.ai/
2. Install and open LM Studio
3. Search for "gemma-2-9b-it-GGUF" 
4. Download model (choose Q4_K_M for good balance)
5. Start local server on port 1234

### Connect ProcessGPT
1. Go to ProcessGPT → "AI Configuration"
