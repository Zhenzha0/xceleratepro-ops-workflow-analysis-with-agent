## Troubleshooting Quick Reference

### Common Issues & Solutions
1. **Model not loading**: Check file path and permissions
2. **Database connection failed**: Verify PostgreSQL running and credentials
3. **Out of memory**: Use int8 model variant or increase system RAM
4. **Slow responses**: Check CPU usage and consider model optimization
5. **Missing data**: Re-run import script and verify CSV file

### Emergency Fallback
If Phi-2 fails, ProcessGPT automatically falls back to OpenAI while maintaining all analysis capabilities with your authentic manufacturing data.
