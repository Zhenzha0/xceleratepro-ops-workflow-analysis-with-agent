# How to Create the Gemma 2B Server File (Step by Step)

## Step 1: Open Notepad (or any text editor)

**Windows:**
1. Click the Start button (Windows logo)
2. Type "notepad" 
3. Click on Notepad when it appears
4. A blank white window opens

**Alternative:** Right-click on your desktop â†’ New â†’ Text Document

## Step 2: Copy the Server Code

1. Go back to this Replit page
2. Find the file called `start_gemma2_server_for_your_folder.py`
3. Select ALL the text in that file (Ctrl+A)
4. Copy it (Ctrl+C)
5. Go back to your Notepad window
6. Paste it (Ctrl+V)

## Step 3: Save the File in the Right Place

1. In Notepad, click File â†’ Save As
2. Navigate to: `C:\Users\rober\my-ai-model\`
3. In the "File name" box, type: `start_gemma2_server_for_your_folder.py`
4. **IMPORTANT:** In the "Save as type" dropdown, select "All Files (*.*)"
5. Click Save

## Step 4: Verify You Did It Right

1. Open File Explorer
2. Go to: `C:\Users\rober\my-ai-model\`
3. You should see the file: `start_gemma2_server_for_your_folder.py`
4. Your folder should now look like:
   ```
   C:\Users\rober\my-ai-model\
   â”œâ”€â”€ models\
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ tinyllama-chat\     (your existing model)
   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ gemma-2b-it\       (newly downloaded)
   â””â”€â”€ start_gemma2_server_for_your_folder.py  (the file you just created)
   ```

## Step 5: Run the Server

1. In File Explorer, click in the address bar where it shows the path
2. Type `cmd` and press Enter
3. This opens Command Prompt in the right folder
4. Type: `python start_gemma2_server_for_your_folder.py`
5. Press Enter
6. You should see messages like "Gemma 2B Local Server Started!"

## If Something Goes Wrong

**"python is not recognized":**
- Try: `py start_gemma2_server_for_your_folder.py`
- Or install Python from python.org

**"No module named...":**
- Run: `pip install huggingface_hub`

**File won't save as .py:**
- Make sure you selected "All Files (*.*)" when saving
- The filename must end with .py

## What Happens When It Works

- You'll see: "ðŸš€ Gemma 2B Local Server Started!"
- Your Command Prompt will stay open (don't close it)
- Go back to ProcessGPT and click "Gemma 2B Local"
- Start asking manufacturing questions with complete privacy
