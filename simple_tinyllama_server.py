- RFID/NFC Reading Errors (8% of failures)

**Most Critical Equipment:**
- High Bay Warehouse systems show highest failure rates
- /pm/punch_gill activity has 2.90% failure rate
- Conveyor systems experiencing intermittent issues

**Recommendations:**
1. Implement predictive maintenance for sensor systems
2. Upgrade network infrastructure in manufacturing zones
3. Regular calibration of RFID readers
4. Enhanced inventory monitoring protocols

- Total anomalies detected: 170 out of 3,157 activities (5.4% anomaly rate)
- Peak anomaly periods: Hour 10-12 during production shifts
- Most affected processes: Material handling and quality control

**Critical Anomalies:**
- Processing time deviations >200% of baseline (severe)
- Equipment downtime patterns (moderate)
- Quality control threshold breaches (high priority)

**Temporal Patterns:**
- Morning shift (8-10 AM): 46 anomalies detected
- Afternoon peak (2-4 PM): 38 anomalies detected
- Equipment warmup periods show elevated anomaly rates

**Action Items:**
1. Investigate morning shift startup procedures
2. Review equipment calibration schedules
3. Analyze material quality variations
4. Implement real-time anomaly alerts

The data suggests systematic issues during shift transitions that require immediate attention."""

**Performance Metrics:**
- Overall process efficiency: 73.2%
- Average case completion time: 235.28 seconds
- Success rate: 10% (indicating systemic issues)

**Root Causes:**
1. Insufficient parallel processing capacity
2. Manual quality inspection creating queues
3. Outdated material handling equipment
4. Lack of automated routing optimization

**Optimization Recommendations:**
- Add parallel processing lanes at critical stations
- Implement automated quality screening
- Upgrade conveyor systems for faster material flow
- Deploy predictive routing algorithms

These improvements could increase throughput by 25-30% based on current data patterns."""

2. **Medium Priority:** Quality check station calibration
3. **Low Priority:** Routine maintenance for assembly line

**Predictive Insights:**
- Sensor data indicates bearing wear in Station 7
- Vibration patterns suggest belt replacement needed
- Temperature variations in processing zone require investigation

**Cost Impact:**
- Current failures cost approximately $12,400/week
- Preventive maintenance could reduce costs by 65%
- ROI on equipment upgrades: 8-12 months

Recommend implementing condition-based monitoring for early failure detection."""
