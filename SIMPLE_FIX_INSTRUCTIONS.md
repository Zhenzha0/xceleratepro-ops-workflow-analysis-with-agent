# Fix the Unicode Error - Simple Steps

## The Problem
Your Python file got corrupted with Unicode characters. Let's fix it.

## Quick Fix:

**Step 1: Delete the broken file**
1. Go to: `C:\Users\rober\my-ai-model\`
2. Delete the file: `start_gemma2.py` (the broken one)

**Step 2: Create a new clean file**
1. Open Notepad
2. Copy ALL the text from the `FIXED_GEMMA_SERVER.py` file (on this Replit page)
3. Paste it into Notepad
4. Save As: `start_gemma2.py` in `C:\Users\rober\my-ai-model\`
5. **IMPORTANT**: Change "Save as type" to "All Files (*.*)"

**Step 3: Test it**
1. Open Command Prompt in `C:\Users\rober\my-ai-model\`
2. Type: `python start_gemma2.py`
3. Press Enter

**You should see:**
```
GEMMA 2B LOCAL SERVER
==================================================
Looking for model in your folder structure...
Found Gemma 2B model at: ./models/gemma-2b-it
Gemma 2B Local Server Started!
```

**If it works:**
- Go to ProcessGPT
- Click "Gemma 2B Local"
- Start asking manufacturing questions

**If you still get errors:**
- Try: `py start_gemma2.py` instead of `python start_gemma2.py`
- Make sure Python is installed properly
