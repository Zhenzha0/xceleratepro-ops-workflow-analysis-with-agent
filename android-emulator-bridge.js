3. **Network Connectivity (18%)**: HTTP status 401/418 authentication failures
4. **Process Timing (9%)**: Activities exceeding expected duration thresholds

Key affected activities:
- /pm/punch_gill: 2.90% failure rate (highest)
- Inventory validation steps showing frequent timeouts
- Equipment status checks failing at various manufacturing stations

This analysis indicates systematic issues with inventory tracking and equipment communication protocols that require immediate attention.`;

**170 anomalies detected** across 301 manufacturing cases (56.5% anomaly rate)

**Temporal Distribution:**
- Peak anomaly period: Hour 10 with 46 anomalies
- Daily pattern shows consistent anomaly clustering during high-production hours
- Processing time deviations exceed normal thresholds by 200%+ in severe cases

**Anomaly Categories:**
- Processing Time Anomalies: Activities taking 3x longer than planned
- Equipment Response Delays: Sensor timeouts and communication failures
- Workflow Sequence Disruptions: Activities starting out of expected order

**Impact Assessment:**
- 28% of anomalies classified as high severity
- Manufacturing efficiency reduced by estimated 15-20%
- Quality control checkpoints showing increased inspection times

Recommended: Immediate investigation of equipment calibration and process scheduling algorithms.`;

3. Equipment status verification: 1.8% failure rate
4. Quality control checkpoints: 1.3% failure rate
5. Material handling operations: 0.9% failure rate

**Activity Performance Insights:**
- /pm/punch_gill shows consistent timeout patterns
- Inventory processes fail primarily during peak load periods
- Equipment verification issues correlate with environmental factors
- Quality checkpoints experience delays during shift changes

**Root Cause Analysis:**
- Network latency affects real-time equipment communication
- Database query timeouts during high-concurrency operations
- Sensor calibration drift causing false positive failures

This data indicates infrastructure optimization opportunities for improved manufacturing reliability.`;
