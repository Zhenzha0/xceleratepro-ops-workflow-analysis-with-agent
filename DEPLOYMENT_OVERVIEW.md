# ProcessGPT Deployment Guide Overview

## Current Status
ProcessGPT is running on Replit with complete manufacturing data analysis capabilities and OpenAI integration.

## Local Deployment Option

For users who want complete data privacy and offline operation, we provide a comprehensive local deployment solution using Phi-2 MediaPipe AI Edge.

- File format explanation (.task bundles)
- Verification commands
- Troubleshooting common issues

### 2. COMPLETE_LOCAL_DEPLOYMENT.md  
**Purpose**: Deploy entire ProcessGPT application locally
- PostgreSQL database setup
- Environment configuration
- Phi-2 integration
- Complete system verification

### 3. DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md
**Purpose**: Verification checklist for successful deployment
- Phase-by-phase validation
- Success criteria
- Performance monitoring
- Final confirmation steps

### 4. PHI2_MEDIAPIPE_ANALYSIS.md
**Purpose**: Technical analysis of .task vs .tflite format
- File format comparison
- Implementation benefits
- Configuration details

## Deployment Process Summary

1. **Download Phi-2 Model** (~1.5-2GB .task bundle)
2. **Set Up Local Database** (PostgreSQL with manufacturing data)
3. **Deploy ProcessGPT** (Complete web application)
4. **Configure Phi-2** (Local AI integration)
5. **Verify System** (All features working offline)

## Expected Results

After successful local deployment:
- Complete data privacy (no external API calls)
- Offline operation capability
- Same ProcessGPT functionality as cloud version
- All 25+ manufacturing analysis types working
- Phi-2 AI responses under 1 second

## File Cleanup Completed

Removed outdated/obsolete files:
- Legacy Gemma 2B guides
- Android emulator configurations  
- Google Colab setups
- Duplicate deployment scripts
- Incorrect file format guides
